# Attendance-Tracking

This is a project to add attendance of students with help of .csv files with all the required data like Name, ID, Dates, and with the help of these we can get a bar graph to assess the attendace of students on the particular dates.

For this I made use of Java, Java Swing library components.

2. Clone the project on to your system using the command: git clone https://github.com/SriRamaD/Attendance-Tracking.git
3. Then in your terminal go to the directory: Attendance-Tracking
4. Then redirect to src folder
5. Then run the following commands
